# Game title: non-Duchenne

- Product description: A web-based 2D game describes a life stage of a character who goes through lots of different social situation to wear a mask. What type of mask? You need to solve the puzzle. Either smile or cover your mouth!
- This is a game created by creative humans in 48h for the GGJ26.
- A non-Duchenne smile is a scientific term for a fake smile. We sometimes are forced to wear a mask of a non-Duchenne smile in order to participate in society. We wanted to make this game to reflect on the importance of balance. We hope anyone playing this game can relate and have a better balance in their social life. Thank you and have fun!
